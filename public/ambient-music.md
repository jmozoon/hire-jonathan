# Ambient Music Placeholder

To add background music:
1. Add an ambient music file named `ambient-music.mp3` to this public folder
2. The file should be:
   - Low volume, atmospheric music
   - Loopable (seamless loop)
   - Royalty-free for your use case
   - Calm and non-distracting

If no music file is provided, the app will fall back to generated ambient tones using Web Audio API.
